# Coding is easy
A series of projects for me to make when I learn a new language. You can use it if you want!

## Projects
Each section will be in order from easiest to hardest, so start with one of the first ones and move down a couple each time. 
- [Starter](#starter)
- [Beginner](#beginner)
- [Intermediate](#intermediate)
- [Hard](#hard)
- [Specific Topics](#specific-topics)
### Starter (this is for learning how to code if you've never done it before, skip this section if you've used a language before and are just trying to learn a new one.)
Hello world! - Print hello world to the screen.
User input - take a users name and output "Hello __"
Conditionals - take a users age and output a different thing based on what they input
Loops - output a list of numbers from 1 to 100, each in a different statement
Functions - call a function that takes three numbers are returns the biggest one, then call it in the main program
### Beginner
Guessing game - make a random number 1-100, then take a users guess and say either higher or lower until they get it, at which point you end the program.
Hangman - make a random number and index into a list of words with it, and then do hangman functionality.
### Intermediate (at this point you should be able to design projects on your own, without my instructions. Take a piece of paper and write pseudocode on it, which is just a simple way to tell your brain how to code something. It doesn't actually have to run. [Psuedocode example](https://www.computerscience.gcse.guru/theory/pseudocode))
