# Coding is easy
Learning to code is often thought of as a hard skill. It's something made for only the most advanced. But I don't think that's true, I think everyone should know how to code. This is a list of projects (along with a philosophy that works for me) that can teach you how to code!


## Philosophy
I hate studying. And by that I mean reading boring books and doing boring problems. When will I need to know how to reverse a linked list? I want to solve problems, and make good software! That is why I am making this list. It is mainly project based, although of course that isn't entirely possible when learning to code from scratch. You don't need to dedicate hours of your life just mindlessly reading a book, it is significantly faster to just write the code yourself!
You still need to learn the best practices, though. For that, I recommend doing some problems that others are also doing, and comparing your answers to them. That also allows you to learn new functions and ways of doing things. I recommend Codewars, Leetcode, or some other site like that. After you make your first intermediate project you should be ready to start doing those.

## How do I learn the syntax if I don't read?
The same way you debug! Just look up specific problems you are having. Say I'm making a chess game, and I want to know how to store an 8x8 list in my language. I don't want to look up how to make a chess game and look at how they did it, since that's not the point! I am going to look up "multi-dimensional list in _your language__". Use something like stack overflow or blog posts to learn, even the official documentation would work!
For each of these projects, I recommend first building it, then looking up other people's implementations, hopefully one's with an explanation so you can understand their thought process. Compare the two, and take ideas they had for next time.

## Projects
Each section will be in order from easiest to hardest, so start with one of the first ones and move down a couple each time. Each one will also have a few ways to expand them, such as making a GUI for it rather than a command line. I recommend starting with Python if this is your first time learning, it is the easiest. If you are going for a specific topic, like game programming or artificial intelligence, you can look at the Specific topics section to see my recommendations. AI is a bit harder, as you do need to learn theory, so I will also recommend the FastAI course for something that shares this philosophy.
